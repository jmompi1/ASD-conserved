Comparative analysis of Autism associated gene expression during brain development across model organisms

In the United States, 3.2% of children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (Shaw et al., 2025) marked by difficulties interacting with other children and an array of behavioral problems. Previous research has found that human autism gene orthologs can regulate social behavior in other species. For example, a recent paper showed that the conserved autism gene nrx-1 seems to be involved in social feeding behavior in C. elegans (Cowen et al., 2024). 

We hypothesize that these conserved autism spectrum disorder (ASD) correlated genes have a crucial role in early brain development, and are interested in comparing the expression of a select number of genes in non mammalian systems. We also plan to study orthologs of undercharacterized polygenic genes that are potentially associated with ASD by examining preexisting GWAS data. We propose that they will be less conserved across non mammalian systems, and if conserved will be expressed at later timepoints in brain development. 

Using gene expression data, we hope to determine the temporal or spatial correlation between expression of these genes during zebrafish, C. elegans and Drosophila brain development. It would be intriguing to investigate these gene orthologs in non mammalian systems since a number of them have shown to be conserved. Each of these model organisms serve as a canvas for several genetic tools to uncover the function of such highly-conserved genes. 

To determine any correlation between the expressional patterns of these monogenic and polygenic ASD-associated gene orthologs, we will download and analyze existing RNA-seq data at different timepoints (if available) during brain development in the three model organisms. If data across different developmental timepoints is not available we will refer to the existing literature. Once we have a comprehensive analysis of the selected genes, we intend to compare expressional patterns specifically between monogenic and polygenic ASD genes to enhance our understanding of how they contribute to brain development. 

Our project could lay the foundation for further genetic studies using these three classic model organisms to determine the role of these genes in brain development. Our data would also contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of ASD phenotypes in humans as well as a better understanding of genes involved in social behavior. Studying the conservation of such genes, combined with their spatiotemporal expression patterns, could unveil ideas about the evolutionary function or importance of these genes/orthologs, whose variants are causative or associated with the development of ASD in humans.
